<h1>One fisherman learns a lesson</h1>

<p>FISHERMAN 1: Oh dear! I lost my fishing rod! Help! Help!</p>
<p>GOD: <i>(Floats to the fisherman.)</i> What can I help you with?</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 1: I lost my fishing rod in the forest! How can my family eat!</p>
<p>GOD: I can help you. <i>(Goes into the forest and finds a golden fishing rod.)</i> Is this fishing rod yours?</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 1: No. Mine was a wooden one.</p>
<p>GOD: Let me try again. <i>(Goes into the forest and finds a silver fishing rod.)</i> Is this yours?</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 1: No. Mine was a wooden one.</p>
<p>GOD: The forest is dark so I couldn't find yours, but let me try again. <i>(Goes into forest and finds a wooden fishing rod.)</i> Is this yours?</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 1: Yes! This is mine! Thanks for finding mine!</p>
<p>GOD: As a reward, I will give you the golden and the siver one to you.</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 1: <i>(Runs to the town.)</i> I am rich! Yay! I can buy everything in this village!</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 2: <i>(Thinks, "I can pretend I lost my fishing rod." Runs to forest and drops fishing rod and comes to god.)</i> I lost my fishing rod! Can you help me?</p>
<p>GOD: Yes. <i>(Goes into the forest and finds a golden fishing rod.)</i> Is this fishing rod yours?</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 2: Yes! This in mine!</p>
<p>GOD: LIAR! As a result, I will not give the golden fishing rod and your fishing rod to you.</p>
<p>FISHERMAN 2: <i>(Cries "Give back my fishing rod." and runs away never to be seen.)</i></p>
<p>Morel: Honesty is the best thing to do.</p>
